## How I built the Memory Game

I manipulated the DOM with vanilla Javascript and ES6 variables, altered part of the HTML and styled the game with CSS. 

* Created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed.
* Created a counter to count the number of moves made by a player and a timer to track the duration of the game.
* Added style to the cards and gameboard.
* create a pop-up modal when player wins game.
